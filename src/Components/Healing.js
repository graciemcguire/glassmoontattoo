                  If you are healing your tattoo with second-skin (tegaderm,
                  saniderm) you can leave this bandage on for 4 to 5 days as
                  long as it is fully sealed and has no leakage. Fluid build up
                  under the bandage is normal and actually aids the healing
                  process but if it leaks out of the bandage, the bandage should
                  be removed.
                </li>
                <br/>

                <li>
                  After the 4-5 days remove the second skin when you are in the
                  shower, clean the tattoo with soapy water (Dr. Bronnerâ€™s soap
                  preferred) and let the tattoo dry completely. With clean
                  hands, apply a layer of unscented lotion to the tattoo and rub
                  it all the way in.
                </li>
                <br/>

                <li>
                  Continue to apply lotion 2-3 times throughout the day as it
                  feels dry.
                </li>
                <br/>

                <li>
                  Wash your tattoo again at night, let dry and apply lotion.
                </li>
                <br/>

                <li>
                  Repeat this process for the following 1.5 weeks or until the
                  tattoo is healed (feels like regular skin again).
                </li>
                <br/>

                <li>
                  Do not at any point expose your healing tattoo to direct
                  sunlight, if you plan to be in the sun make sure to keep your
                  tattoo fully covered.

                <li>
                  Do not submerge your tattoo in any bodies of water (hot-tub,
                  lake, ocean, pool) until it is fully healed.

                  If your tattoo scabs at all do not pick at the scabs as it
                  will remove the pigment, scabs will heal on their own and
                  retain pigment if they are not messed with.
